# GGNN
1. The GGNN folder is a PyTorch implementation of the Gated Graph Sequence Neural Networks(GGNN) as described in the paper [Gated Graph Sequence Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05493.pdf) by Y. Li, D. Tarlow, M. Brockschmidt, and R. Zemel. And it was forked from [chingyaoc/ggnn.pytorch](https://github.com/chingyaoc/ggnn.pytorch).
2. The DeGraphCS folder is a Pytorch implementation of the DEGRAPHCS as described in the paper [DEGRAPHCS: EMBEDDING VARIABLE-BASED FLOW GRAPH FOR NEURAL CODE SEARCH](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.13020.pdf) by Zeng, C., Yu, Y., Li, S., Xia, X., Wang, Z., Geng, M., Xiao, B., Dong, W., & Liao, X. And it was forked from [degraphcs/DeGraphCS](https://github.com/degraphcs/DeGraphCS). This paper is about code search and uses GGNN in its model.
